**Name :** Project 2 - Data Structures, Unit Tests and Microcontroller UART

**Objectives :** This project has the following objectives

1. Implement a circular buffer on the heap that is architecture independent in nature
1. Write unit tests on the cmocka test framework to test each module of the circular buffer
1. Design a customized interrupt based binary logger that logs data over the UART interface


**Tools :** This project uses Freescale's FRDM KL25z, the BeagleBone black along with Kinetis Design Studio as the preferred IDE.
